# SalernOS Kernel
This is a kernel project for educational purposes. This branch is a work-in-progress rewrite of the original [master](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SalernOS-Kernel/tree/glorious-2022) and [hellow](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SalernOS-Kernel/tree/hellow) branches which were themselves rewrites of previous versions.
I'd invite you to check out the other branches since there's not much to see here right now. If you're interested in this branch, check [docs/TODO.txt](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SalernOS-Kernel/blob/main/docs/TODO.txt).
